# COVID 19 Analysis Project

This repository contains the work of Team 11 for the COVID Policy Analysis project in DS 310 - Data Mechanics. The project aims to analyze the effectiveness of COVID-19 policies implemented across various countries and their impact on cases, recoveries, and deaths.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to calculate the growth percentage change of COVID-19 metrics and compare these against the policies implemented by different countries. We aim to determine the effectiveness of public transportation closure and testing policies for anyone showing symptoms, among other policies.

## Repository Structure

(To be updated)

- `data/`: This folder contains all the datasets used in the analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for the data processing and analysis.
- `reports/`: Generated analysis reports and visualizations.
- `PowerBI/`: Power BI files and related resources for visualization.

## Datasets

The analysis is based on the following datasets:
- Cases: COVID-19 confirmed cases.
- Deaths: COVID-19 related deaths.
- Recoveries: COVID-19 recoveries.
- Policies: COVID-19 policies implemented by countries.

These datasets are transformed and loaded into Azure Synapse for big data processing and analyzed using Power BI.
